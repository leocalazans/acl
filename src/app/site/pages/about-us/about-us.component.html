                        The objective of the game is to send the ball to the oponent side of the table with a maximum of three touches and a minimum of two using any part o their body except their hands and arms.

                        AirSoccer, as it is known in the U.S, began as a warm up exercise for professional soccer players in Europe, but soon after, it became its own sport, with its own federation and league.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game itself consist of 2-4 players sending a soccer-like ball from one side of the table to the other.
                        A number of world-class soccer players have been attracted by the game, and the sport is now aiming for Olympic inclusion. Our special designed table provides more dynamic to games, with an angle that makes the ball go faster, testing each player's skills to the limit!

                        The AirSoccer table is an exclusive and scientifically designed table, in which after a lot of studies , we concluded that a slight inclination would be the best option for this sport. The table is made with a steel or aluminum frame, a water resistant surface, a fixed net in the middle of it made of reinforced a material, and it also has an exclusive rubber bumper protector covering the entire perimeter of the table to avoid any acidentes.
